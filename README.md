# Expense_Tracker
Expense Tracking:
This app allows users to track their expenses by adding entries with a category (Essential Needs or Discretionary Spending), an amount, and a description. It automatically calculates the remaining balance based on the user’s monthly salary and total expenses.

Data Storage:
All expense details — including date, category, amount, description, remaining balance, and subcategory — are securely stored in a MongoDB database for easy review and retrieval.

Budget Management:
Users can set monthly limits for both Essential Needs and Discretionary Spending. The app alerts the user when their spending is nearing or has exceeded the set limits.

Visual Insights:
The app provides a pie chart to display the overall expense distribution across categories, and a bar chart to analyze expenses by subcategory, making it simple to understand where the money goes.

User Interaction:
The interface features buttons and dialogs for adding expenses, viewing balances, setting or updating category budgets, and accessing stored records. Alerts and messages guide the user, ensuring accurate data entry and notifying them about errors, such as incorrect date formats.

Additional Features:
Users can review expenses by date and category, view their total income, and adjust their salary settings as needed, making it a comprehensive tool for personal financial management.
